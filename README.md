# Hi there, I'm LwZhan ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree at the **School of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence**, **Wuhan University of Technology**, Wuhan, China. My research interests are in:

- **Computer Vision**  
- **Remote Sensing Image Processing**  
- **Multimodal Applications**

## ðŸ“š About Me

I am passionate about exploring how computer vision can be applied to real-world problems, especially in the context of remote sensing images. My work focuses on developing new methods for understanding and processing visual data from various modalities.

## ðŸ§  Current Research

My current research involves the integration of computer vision techniques with remote sensing, aiming to improve the interpretation of satellite and drone-captured images. I'm particularly interested in exploring how multimodal data can be leveraged for more accurate predictions and insights.
